Pre-requirements
----------------
* NVIDIA CUDA-capable graphics card.
* NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.0
* Visual Studio 2010 (Windows only)

Installation (Windows)
----------------------
Easiest way to install it is to import the .sln
project file to your Visual Studio 2010 with
CUDA SDK installed. From there, you should be
able to simply build the solution. 

Installation (UNIX)
-------------------
You will have to run the nvcc compiler manually
on the project. If you have all the required
libraries installed, it is as simple as
running from the root directory.

    nvcc *.cu *.cpp -o SWIG -Wall
